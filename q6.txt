The database schema we have chosen is a single table with 3 columns; subject,
predicate, and object.

The commands to create an empty database with this schema:

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS RDFTable;
CREATE TABLE RDFTable ( subject TEXT,
                        predicate TEXT,
                        object TEXT);

Our strategy to convert the RDF data into a database with the above schema 
involves parsing the RDF data, replacing all instances of prefixes (or bases),
replaced fully with their appropriate URIs. Similarly, any RDF data that uses
the conventions of the comma (,) or semicolon (;) to substitute the subject and
the predicate or only the subject (respectively) with their original definitions
at the beginning of a given query will also be fully replaced with their 
appropriate URIs, resulting in every query becoming full URI triples. Of course,
any literals will remain as literals. We will treat each triple as a single 
tuple in the database, with the subject, predicate, and object placed in its respective column in the RDFTable in SQLite.

The following example of RDF graph data is from Edmonton.txt:

...







It becomes the following after being parsed in q8 (ready for database input):
